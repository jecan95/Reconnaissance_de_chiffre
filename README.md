# Computer vision project for digit recognition

The objective of this personal project, carried out outside the school framework, was to use my knowledge acquired during my studies to create a neural network capable of recognizing numbers from the camera of my computer. To create such a model, it is necessary to follow the classic steps of a machine learning project, which consist of:
* Prepare the necessary training data
* Build the neural network model
* Train this model using training data
* Use this model to make predictions on unknown data.
